## Uniswap Donations UI 

This is the UI to interact with the Uniswap Donations Smart Contract  deployed on Sepolia.

With a connected wallet, you can enable donations to a third party when you swap tokens. 

There can only be one donation recipient at a time.

When you enable donations, you'll need to specify the recipient and the percentage to donate.

After enabling donations, whenever you perform a swap, the specified amount of the percentage (of the first currency) will be sent to the specified recipient.
